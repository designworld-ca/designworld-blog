## Shiny Shiny Cloud

Just attended a Softchoice seminar on how to migrate to Azure.  Lots of claims made but not much to back them up.  The charts and templates are great but I thought the best remark suggested that you should not modernize before going to the cloud.  
Just "lift and shift" don't tickle it!  This speaks to the many delays that can happen when modernization is attempted.  Large Enterprises don't move quickly and modernizing is risky.  The consequence is that modernizing just happens later which for some will mean never.
