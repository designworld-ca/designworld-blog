Great post from Andrey Sitnik about lessons learned from the [Soviet Space program](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/what-i-learned-as-a-developer-from-accidents-in-space).

Short form is
 - Never blame users
 - Report issues no matter what
 - Have trust in automated tools --Let the robots do the work!
 
 I see that last point echoed today by Tim Hall, [Why no GUI installations anymore?](https://oracle-base.com/blog/2020/01/29/why-no-gui-installations-anymore)
 
 > No professional DBA should be using a GUI for anything, if there is a possibility to script that action.
 
 Onwards to automated deployments!
