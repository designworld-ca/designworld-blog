## NET::ERR_CERT_INVALID Chrome: what?

Ever see this after messing around with self signed certificates on your network?
uses encryption to protect your information. When Google Chrome tried to connect to ###.###.### this time, 
the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. 
This may happen when an attacker is trying to pretend to be ###.###.###, or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. 
Your information is still secure because Google Chrome stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.
You can't visit ###.###.### right now because the website sent scrambled credentials that Google Chrome can't process. 
Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later


*But what if you need to go to the site anyway?  Despite the warnings

From [here](https://www.noreplied.com/how-to-access-site-with-neterr_cert_invalid-error-in-chrome/)

Put your cursor on the page, not the browser bar and....
type the word “thisisunsafe” in one line

That is so crazy and hard to find..why...why...why?
